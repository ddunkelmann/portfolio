      <description>Background This shiny application was built after my family and I joked about tracking our weekly poker games. We wondered if our comments after a session like Person X won so much today or we had a lot of flushs today would be close to the truth. This application is therefore designed, to allow me to track our games while we are playing.
You can find the application here.
Idea and Hypothesis The basic idea was to track information like who won, which hand did he win with, who played against him and how much money was bet.</description>
