      <title>Mario Kart Setup Analysis</title>

      <description>Background This analysis was made for a project within my friends, where each one gives a presentation on a topic of his or her choosing. The other participants have no background in statistics or data analysis, therefore my goal was to keep the analysis as understandable as possible without loosing interesting insights. I wanted to give my listeners something they keep after my presentation and can use for a specific purpose.</description>

      <title>Poker Data Collection Shiny</title>

      <description>Background This shiny application was built after my family and I joked about tracking our weekly poker games. We wondered if our comments after a session like Person X won so much today or we had a lot of flushs today would be close to the truth. This application is therefore designed, to allow me to track our games while we are playing.
You can find the application here.
Idea and Hypothesis The basic idea was to track information like who won, which hand did he win with, who played against him and how much money was bet.</description>

      <title>Spotify Top 100 2017 Analysis</title>

      <description>Background This project was a parallel training session during my university studies, to practice for my practical exam in the Intro Analytics Class. It was also my first time trying and working with Kaggle and a &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; non-test Dataset (like cars or diamonds).
Therefore this project was quite old and did not use all of the tricks and code practices I know at this point. I revisited it and rewrote most of the code and plots.</description>
